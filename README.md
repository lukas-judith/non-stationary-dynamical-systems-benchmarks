# Non-Stationary Dynamical Systems Benchmarks

The code was created in part of my master's thesis at Heidelberg University, working in the [group of Prof. Daniel Durstewitz](https://durstewitzlab.github.io). The focus of my thesis is the reconstruction of dynamical systems with non-stationary parameters from time series data, using recurrent neural neural networks. The code provided can be used to generate different benchmark systems to assess the performance of such models.

*TODO: provide examples of generated benchmark systems.*
